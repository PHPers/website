Running using docker
====================

You can run watcher server using docker by: `./sculpin-docker.sh generate --watch --server` (sudo may be required)

Docker is a basic tool, like git or java, that you should start incorporating into your daily development and ops practices.

Use Docker as version control system for your entire app's operating system
Use Docker when you want to distribute/collaborate on your app's operating system with a team
Use Docker to run your code on your laptop in the same environment as you have on your server (try the building tool)
Use Docker whenever your app needs to go through multiple phases of development (dev/test/qa/prod, try Drone or Shippable, both do Docker CI/CD)
Use Docker with your Chef Cookbooks and Puppet Manifests (remember, Docker doesn't do configuration management)
